\title{
Function to make predictions at new locations
}
\description{
For each set of parameter values sampled by the model (including values of Z),
simulate the occurrence probabilities for each species at each new location.
}
\usage{
predict(object, newdata, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
A bayescomm object
}
  \item{newdata}{
A data.frame with the same columns as X from the original BC model
}
  \item{...}{
further arguments passed to or from other methods.
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
An array of occurrence probabilities.
Rows index locations.  Columns index species.  Slices index MCMC samples.
